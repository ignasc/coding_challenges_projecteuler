## Coding challenges from ProjectEuler website

This is where I will be posting solutions to coding challenges, that are found in the [Project Euler archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

### Main challenges
- Solve the problems without using any code that has not been written by me.
- I can only lookup certain math formulas or definitions of what the challenge is asking (eg. lookup what is a prime number, but NOT how to check if the number is prime)
- Write clean, simple and readable code.
